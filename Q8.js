// //8Map to objects
// importance: 5
// You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.

// Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.

// For instance:

let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

let usersMapped = users.map(user => ({
    fullName: `${user.name} ${user.surname}`,
    id: user.id
}))

// /*
// usersMapped = [
//   { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
//   { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
//   { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
// ]
// */
    console.log(usersMapped)
alert( usersMapped[0].id ) // 1
alert( usersMapped[0].fullName ) // John Smith
// So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. Thereâ€™s a small catch. you need extra set of () 
//where the computer thinks its running a function but it's actually an object
